## 📌 About the Project

This is a **Movie Recommender System** that suggests similar movies based on the one you select.  
It uses **content-based filtering** powered by **machine learning techniques** like **TF-IDF** and **cosine similarity**.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Movie data is processed using `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.
- A similarity matrix is created using **TF-IDF Vectorizer** or **CountVectorizer**.
- When you select a movie, the app finds the **top 5 similar movies** based on content.
- Posters are fetched using the **TMDB API** for a better user experience.
